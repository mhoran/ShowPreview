* HTML5 audio no-go in Android; Flash component for FroYo, else launch default
  player.  Test on iPhone. jPlayer probably makes sense here ...
* Use geo-location to find the show you're looking for is at, instead of
  limiting the search to today (limit to this week, perhaps.)
* Come up with a better name.
* Empty search leaves spinner running.
* Fix CSS for mobile.
* Hide the HTML5 audio control (and Flash control) altogether.  Instead,
  control with JavaScript and custom buttons.
* Fix the show link.
* Add to the wiki!
* Gracefully handle backend errors.
* Move Songkick API calls to backend.
